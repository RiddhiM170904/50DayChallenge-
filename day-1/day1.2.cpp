// // The code above is a C++ solution to the problem of finding the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n. The function `missingNumber` takes a vector of integers `nums` as input and returns the missing number. It uses the XOR operation to efficiently find the missing number by XORing all elements in the array with their indices and the size of the array. The final result is the missing number.
