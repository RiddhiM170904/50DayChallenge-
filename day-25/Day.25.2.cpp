// The code defines a class Solution with a public method rotate that takes a vector of integers nums and an integer k as input. It rotates the elements of nums to the right by k positions using the reverse method. The rotation is done in three steps: first, the entire vector is reversed, then the first k elements are reversed, and finally, the remaining elements are reversed to achieve the desired rotation.
